42 School is a **FREE** programming school that defies traditional education, by enforcing the peer-to-peer methodology, where you learn from and with your peers. There are no assigned teachers in this school. If you're not sure about something, Google, the person next you or on the bottom of the room are your best options. Just make sure you learn how to learn!

The 42 program is divided into 3 major events:

 - `Piscine`: a moment of intensive evaluation, where the students get to know the 42 methodology, to understand if they are fit to it. You'll learn the fundamentals of C and Shell programming through projects, designed to approach different topics of this language. You'll have an exam every week, until you reach the final week, where you'll have the final exam. The piscine is where you'll meet a lot of people, so make sure you don't sit in the corner!

 - `Common Core`: if you are one of the chosen on the Piscine, congratulations! You are now in the main course of the 42 program. The process is the same, enroll in projects and unlock new ones until you reach the final one (you'll also have exams). The projects are divided into ranks, and each rank has an exam that must be validated to unlock the next rank. After reaching and validating the last rank, you must get a paid internship. Should you go through the internship successfuly, your Common Core is completed! Don't expect the projects to be as easy as the piscine ones though...
