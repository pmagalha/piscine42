# Description

42 School is a **FREE** programming school that defies traditional education, by enforcing a self-taught and peer-to-peer methodology, which I found to be very suitable for me. There are no assigned teachers in this school and no schedule. We create our own organization and make our own rules (well, sort of... more on that later). The assigned projects must be completed in any way throughout these very intense weeks so the internet, Google, Bing, Chat GPT, the bible, a person next to you or on a corner of the room are all important and valid sources of information.

The code contained in this folder concerns all the work I've done throughout the Piscine, or what I managed to get done. The piscine is a tough, very intensive experience in which I spent around 12h a day, 30 days in a row sitting in the campus, learning the basics of C programming, the basics on 'how to person', and some more.

 - `Piscine Tips`:
- Don't be shy. Talk to your peers, they are your main support network throughout the experience and source of valuable knowledge, as you will be for them.
- Know and respect the rules. You don't want to waste precious time of studying doing community service, as I did, for being silly and forgetting to NOT PLACE A BOTTLE OF WATER ON THE WORKSPACE. This duck was a prodcut of my time spent in community service. ![367430862_845678193939000_5328599984402720079_n](https://github.com/pmagalha/piscine42/assets/136360645/c05e9275-cc7c-45d7-8fcc-5b7554768477)
I had fun doing it, tbh.
- Meal prep. This tip saved my a** during the piscine and kept me healthy, well-nourished and strong enough for my brain not to give out during these intense weeks.
- Don't get stunlocked by the difficulty of a specific exercise. Just push through when you are stuck, move forward and you will notice that the first exercises of the subjects are always easier. Do as many as you can, and know that it is better to move forward and then get back to the hardest exercises later. You will learn more this way.
- Don't just copy code from githubs like this one. Understand the code, try to implement your own solutions. You will have to learn this stuff for the upcoming exams anyway.
- Don't cheat, obviously. Cheating on the exams is heavily punished, so don't even risk it. You would be cheating yourself too, and don't forget you're here to learn and become a professional sw developer, not to get a diploma. This is not college, it's way cooler.
- Have fun! The piscine is not a competition. You will make long lasting friendships during this period. Alow yourself to be supported and support your peers when needed. Don't let your closest peers give-up till the very end. Make a blood pact with them if necessary. This has not actually been scientificaly proven to work.
